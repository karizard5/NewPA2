/* This type defines a battleship board, which contains a count of rows and columns,
   as well as the grid of cells. The reason a class was used in this case over a struct
   was due to the pass by reference nature of classes. In order to properly update the board
   without having to pass a new copy back and forth, a class was used.*/
