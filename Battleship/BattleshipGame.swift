        ******* Welcome to BattleShip ******* \n
        This is a game of strategy and luck! \n
        Here are the rules: \n
        1. This is a two player game \n
        2. Player 1 is you and Player 2 is the computer \n
        3. The Goal of the game is to sink all your opponent's ships.
           Each player has 5 ships that are placed on the board. \n
        4. To guess the location of a ship, enter the coordinates based
           on the board labels. \n
        5. If you hit a ship, the "-" will be replaced with a "*". \n
        6. If you miss, the "-" will be replaced with an "m". \n
        7. Since some ships are larger than others, you will be told
           if you have sunk a ship completely.
